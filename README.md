# Christmas Special Subnet

In this christmas season , I have deployed a defi game contract to the local subnet that I created using Linux terminal.

## Description

In this simple game contract , i have implemented the basic ERC20 functions which I have shown the previous projects too. The user before deploying has to enter the token name and token symbol in order to deploy. The token name and token symbol get initialised to those values after deploying. You can interact with the other ERC20 functions as well as the christmas function where the user gets free 1000 tokens as it is christmas season . 

 ## Getting Started
 
 ### Executing the code

* Install the solidity code and run it locally or head to this website- [https://remix.ethereum.org/] which is an online IDE to compile and deploy contracts.

* Follow the readme file in order to create a subnet , enter the configurations and deploy the subnet - [https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/blob/main/README.md]

* You will get the network configurations in your terminal which you can add to your metamask.

* You can get test tokens to your network using the private key that you get in your terminal.

* Change the environment and connect your metamask with test tokens and deploy the contract

* Lastly, you can interact with the functions by paying transaction fees from your respective tokens and network.
